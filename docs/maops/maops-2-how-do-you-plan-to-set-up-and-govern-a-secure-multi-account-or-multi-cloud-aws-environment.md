# MAOPS 2: How do you plan to set up and govern a secure, multi-account, or multi-cloud AWS environment?

Businesses that are expanding their footprint on AWS due to mergers and acquisitions, or are planning to enhance an established AWS environment, need have a foundation on AWS for their cloud environment. Establishing a cloud foundation on AWS requires guidance tailored to your business needs. Using a capability-based approach, you can create an environment to deploy, operate, and govern your workloads. A capability includes a definition, scenarios, opinionated guidance, and supporting automation to establish and operate a specific part of a cloud environment. Capabilities are components that can help you plan, implement, and operate your cloud environment, and include people, process, and technology considerations. Capabilities are designed to integrate into your overall technology environment.

## MAOPS02-BP01 Each company has identified their primary Region

For many services, you can choose an AWS Region that specifies where your resources are managed. Regions are sets of AWS resources located in the same geographical area. You don't need to choose a Region for the AWS Management Console or for some services, such as AWS Identity and Access Management.

## MAOPS02-BP02 Configure AWS Control Tower, AWS Config, and AWS CloudFormation

AWS Control Tower offers the easiest way to set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment. It establishes a landing zone that is based on best-practices blueprints, and it enables governance using guardrails you can choose from a pre-packaged list.

## MAOPS02-BP03 Automate infrastructure as code (IaC) using Cloud Formation or Terraform

AWS CloudFormation helps you model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources by treating infrastructure as code.

## MAOPS02-BP04 Automate resource compliance using tools like AWS Config

AWS Config is a config tool that helps you assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations and relationships of your resources.

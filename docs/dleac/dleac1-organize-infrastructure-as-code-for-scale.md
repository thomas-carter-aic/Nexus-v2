# [DL.EAC.1] Organize infrastructure as code for scale

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Infrastructure as code (IaC) provides consistent and automated infrastructure management capabilities which are important to DevOps adoption. Effectively organizing and scaling IaC within your organization enhances flexibility, readability, and reusability across multiple teams, while streamlining infrastructure provisioning and maintenance.

When working with IaC files and artifacts, apply modern practices such as modular design for improved management and reuse, and maintain thorough in-code documentation for clarity. Adopt IaC-specific design patterns, like breaking down infrastructure templates into reusable modules. Treat IaC testing with the same rigor as other software, focusing on security risks like excessive privileges or open security groups, while upholding quality standards. Use version control for IaC templates to ensure traceable changes, reliable rollbacks, and efficient sharing across the organization.

You must carefully consider your organization's governance structure when deciding how to implement IaC at scale. Depending on the specific needs, your organization might find one model more suitable than the other, or even adopt a hybrid approach that combines elements of both. The right approach to scaling is dependent on factors such as team dynamics, operating model, application type, and the desired rate of change.

For example, services like [AWS Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/) and [AWS Proton](https://aws.amazon.com/proton/) provide distinct methods to distribute and consume secure-by-default software components and IaC in different ways. Service Catalog suits organizations favoring predefined deployment standards and centrally defined resource provisioning, while AWS Proton is ideal for organizations that allow development teams to maintain infrastructure and application autonomy. Some organizations might prefer to adopt a fully decentralized approach, where individual teams provision and manage their own [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) IaC templates. Choose the tools and distribution methods that best support your governance model and business goals.

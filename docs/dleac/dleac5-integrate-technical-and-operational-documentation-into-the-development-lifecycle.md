# [DL.EAC.5] Integrate technical and operational documentation into the development lifecycle

**Category:** RECOMMENDED

Integrating documentation and code involves creating, maintaining, and publishing documentation using the same tools and processes used for application development. With this approach, changes to systems should be immediately reflected in documentation, reducing the risk of discrepancies between system behavior and documentation. By making documentation part of the development lifecycle, it becomes a living document that evolves with the system over time.

Documentation should be stored in a versioned source code repository and written in a machine-readable markup language, such as Markdown. The documentation can be made directly accessible through the repository or through knowledge sharing tools capable of rendering the markup language, like Git-based wikis, static site generators, or directly in developers' integrated development environments (IDEs).

Code should include clear, insightful comments and commit messages should be structured using a machine-readable specification, such as [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This information can be used as a source to generate detailed documentation and change logs using tools specific to the programming language and platforms being used. Many of these tools can create API references, class diagrams, or other technical documents from inline comments in your source code, ensuring the documentation is always in line with the most recent changes. Automate this process by adding a stage to the deployment pipeline to generate documentation with every change to a main, releasable branch.

This approach is not only limited to documenting code, but also can be used to store operational documentation like incident response procedures, disaster recovery plans, training material, and onboarding processes. While some aspects of these documents still likely require manual effort to create, the benefits of incorporating these documents into the development lifecycle include enforced reviews of changes, ability to write tests to suggest updating documentation when changes are significant or made to important components, and versioning the documents for auditability.

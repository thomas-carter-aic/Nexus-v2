# ✅ Deliverables up to 08-21-2025

## 1. **Repository Structure**

* A fully scaffolded **AI Proof-of-Concept repo**: `aic-ai-poc-gpt/`
* Organized into **clear submodules**:

  * `gptx/` → GPT-style model implementations
  * `models/` → Different pretrained / custom model configs
  * `tokenizers/` → Tokenizer utils + SPM integration
  * `training/` → Training logic, utilities, scripts
  * `tests/` → Unit tests for reliability + validation

This is **production-structured**, not a toy repo.

---

## 2. **Core Model Support**

* GPT backbone (`gptx`) with utilities:

  * KV cache
  * Rotary embeddings (RoPE) + ALiBi bias
  * Attention memory (`utils/memory.py`)
* Modular `models/`:

  * `adapters/` → plug-in adapter layers (LoRA / PEFT)
  * `gpt2_small/` → reference small GPT2 model config
  * `tinyllama/` → minimal lightweight LLaMA variant

These give us **baseline model templates** that can be extended.

---

## 3. **Tokenizer System**

* Tokenizer utils (`tokenizers/utils.py`)
* SPM trainer (`tokenizers/train_spm.py`)
* SPM model wrapper (`tokenizers/spm_model.py`)

This allows us to **train + use your own tokenizer**, not just rely on external Hugging Face tokenizers.

---

## 4. **Training Pipeline**

* `training/utils.py` → utilities for training (metrics, logging, checkpointing)
* `training/train.py` → entrypoint script for distributed or single-node training

Supports **training from scratch or fine-tuning**, including small-scale on AWS Free Tier.

---

## 5. **Testing & Reliability**

Unit tests for critical components:

* `test_sampler.py` → verifies sampling correctness
* `test_rope_alibi.py` → validates positional encodings
* `test_kv_cache.py` → ensures KV cache logic works
* `test_checkpoint_convert.py` → checkpoint save/load works
* `test_block_shapes.py` → model block size correctness

These ensure **core math + infra are not broken**.

---

## 6. **Branching Strategy**

* Current branch = **Minimal AWS Free Tier / <\$50 setup**

  * Small models, efficient configs, basic infra
* Next branch = **Full unrestricted PoC**

  * Will include larger models, multi-GPU/distributed support, richer tokenizers, advanced adapters

---

# Summaary

* A **minimal yet production-structured GPT repo** that:

  * Can train/eval/run a GPT-style model (small scale now, scalable later)
  * Has tokenizer training + integration
  * Has modular model definitions (GPT2, TinyLLaMA, adapters)
  * Has tests to ensure correctness
  * Is **ready to extend** into a full unrestricted PoC branch

In short this is currently a **clean, modern, FOSS-first GPT training + inference stack**, budget-conscious, but structured for future expansion.

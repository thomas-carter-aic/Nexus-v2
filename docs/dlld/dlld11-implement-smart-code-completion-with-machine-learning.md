# [DL.LD.11] Implement smart code completion with machine-learning

**Category:** OPTIONAL

Use machine learning (ML) algorithms within development tools to predict and suggest code as developers write, based on patterns and commonly used syntax. This can improve development experience, speed up the coding process, and reduce the potential for errors.

Incorporate ML-powered code generators into your developer tools, such as IDEs or text editors, for real-time, intelligent code recommendations. Train and refine these tools with regular feedback to ensure they align with your specific coding patterns and practices.

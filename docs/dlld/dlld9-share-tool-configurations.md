# [DL.LD.9] Share tool configurations

**Category:** OPTIONAL

Sharing tool configuration among project or team members helps ensure a uniform set up of integrated development environment (IDE) settings, text editor preferences, and pre-commit hooks. Having these configurations tailored to each code base can reduce discrepancies in code styles and promote seamless collaboration and a predictable developer experience. This enables any developer working within that repository to begin working in the environment quickly while maintaining team norms.

Commit tool configuration files to a shared repository. Periodically review these shared configurations, ensuring they remain updated as tools and practices evolve. While the idea promotes consistency, be mindful of the need to occasionally tailor configurations for specific tasks and preferences.

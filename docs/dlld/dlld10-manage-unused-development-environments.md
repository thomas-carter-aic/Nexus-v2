# [DL.LD.10] Manage unused development environments

**Category:** OPTIONAL

Properly managing unused environments prevents unnecessary resource utilization and potential security threats. When development environments are not in use, the environment and associated resources should be disabled or deleted.

Managing unused development environments requires tracking, disabling, or removing development setups that are dormant or no longer in active use. Regularly audit the active and inactive development environments. Implement automated tools or scripts that monitor activity and provide notifications regarding dormant environments.

Once identified, these environments should be archived, disabled, or removed, depending on the future needs of the project. Treat development environments as ephemeral environments to reduces the risk of incurring unexpected cost and leaving potentially insecure resources running.

# OPS04-BP01 Identify key performance indicators

Implementing observability in your workload starts with understanding its state and making data-driven decisions based on business requirements. One of the most effective ways to ensure alignment between monitoring activities and business objectives is by defining and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs).

**Desired outcome:** Efficient observability practices that are tightly aligned with business objectives, ensuring that monitoring efforts are always in service of tangible business outcomes.

**Common anti-patterns:**

* Undefined KPIs: Working without clear KPIs can lead to monitoring too much or too little, missing vital signals.

* Static KPIs: Not revisiting or refining KPIs as the workload or business objectives evolve.

* Misalignment: Focusing on technical metrics that donâ€™t correlate directly with business outcomes or are harder to correlate with real-world issues.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

* Ease of issue identification: Business KPIs often surface issues more clearly than technical metrics. A dip in a business KPI can pinpoint a problem more effectively than sifting through numerous technical metrics.

* Business alignment: Ensures that monitoring activities directly support business objectives.

* Efficiency: Prioritize monitoring resources and attention on metrics that matter.

* Proactivity: Recognize and address issues before they have broader business implications.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To effectively define workload KPIs:

1. **Start with business outcomes:** Before diving into metrics, understand the desired business outcomes. Is it increased sales, higher user engagement, or faster response times?

2. **Correlate technical metrics with business objectives:** Not all technical metrics have a direct impact on business outcomes. Identify those that do, but it's often more straightforward to identify an issue using a business KPI.

3. **Use [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html):** Employ CloudWatch to define and monitor metrics that represent your KPIs.

4. **Regularly review and update KPIs:** As your workload and business evolve, keep your KPIs relevant.

5. **Involve stakeholders:** Involve both technical and business teams in defining and reviewing KPIs.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium

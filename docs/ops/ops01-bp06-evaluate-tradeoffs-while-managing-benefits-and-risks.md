# OPS01-BP06 Evaluate tradeoffs while managing benefits and risks

Competing interests from multiple parties can make it challenging to prioritize efforts, build capabilities, and deliver outcomes aligned with business strategies. For example, you may be asked to accelerate speed-to-market for new features over optimizing IT infrastructure costs. This can put two interested parties in conflict with one another. In these situations, decisions need to be brought to a higher authority to resolve conflict. Data is required to remove emotional attachment from the decision-making process.

The same challenge may occur at a tactical level. For example, the choice between using relational or non-relational database technologies can have a significant impact on the operation of an application. It's critical to understand the predictable results of various choices.

AWS can help you educate your teams about AWS and its services to increase their understanding of how their choices can have an impact on your workload. Use the resources provided by [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/programs/) ([AWS Knowledge Center](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/), [AWS Discussion Forums](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/index.jspa), and [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home/)) and [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) to educate your teams. For further questions, reach out to Support.

AWS also shares operational best practices and patterns in [The Amazon Builders' Library](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/). A wide variety of other useful information is available through the [AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/) and [The Official AWS Podcast](https://aws.amazon.com/podcasts/aws-podcast/).

**Desired outcome:** You have a clearly defined decision-making governance framework to facilitate important decisions at every level within your cloud delivery organization. This framework includes features like a risk register, defined roles that are authorized to make decisions, and a defined models for each level of decision that can be made. This framework defines in advance how conflicts are resolved, what data needs to be presented, and how options are prioritized, so that once decisions are made you can commit without delay. The decision-making framework includes a standardized approach to reviewing and weighing the benefits and risks of every decision to understand the tradeoffs. This may include external factors, such as adherence to regulatory compliance requirements.

**Common anti-patterns:**

* Your investors request that you demonstrate compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). You do not consider the tradeoffs between satisfying their request and continuing with your current development efforts. Instead, you proceed with your development efforts without demonstrating compliance. Your investors stop their support of your company over concerns about the security of your platform and their investments.

* You have decided to include a library that one of your developers found on the internet. You have not evaluated the risks of adopting this library from an unknown source and do not know if it contains vulnerabilities or malicious code.

* The original business justification for your migration was based upon the modernization of 60% of your application workloads. However, due to technical difficulties, a decision was made to modernize only 20%, leading to a reduction in planned benefits long-term, increased operator toil for infrastructure teams to manually support legacy systems, and greater reliance on developing new skillsets in your infrastructure teams that were not planning for this change.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Fully aligning and supporting board-level business priorities, understanding the risks to achieving success, making informed decisions, and acting appropriately when risks impede chances for success. Understanding the implications and consequences of your decisions helps you to prioritize your options and bring leaders into agreement faster, leading to improved business outcomes. Identifying the available benefits of your choices and being aware of the risks to your organization helps you make data-driven decisions, rather than relying on anecdotes.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Managing benefits and risks should be defined by a governing body that drives the requirements for key decision-making. You want decisions to be made and prioritized based on how they benefit the organization, with an understanding of the risks involved. Accurate information is critical for making the organizational decisions. This should be based on solid measurements and defined by common industry practices of cost benefit analysis. To make these types of decisions, strike a balance between centralized and decentralized authority. There is always a tradeoff, and it's important to understand how each choice impacts defined strategies and desired business outcomes.

### Implementation steps

1. Formalize benefits measurement practices within a holistic cloud governance framework.

   1. Balance central control of decision-making with decentralized authority for some decisions.

   2. Understand that burdensome decision-making processes imposed on every decision can slow you down.

   3. Incorporate external factors into your decision making process (like compliance requirements).

2. Establish an agreed-upon decision-making framework for various levels of decisions, which includes who is required to unblock decisions that are subject to conflicted interests.

   1. Centralize one-way door decisions that could be irreversible.

   2. Allow two-way door decisions to be made by lower level organizational leaders.

3. Understand and manage benefits and risks. Balance the benefits of decisions against the risks involved.

   1. **Identify benefits**: Identify benefits based on business goals, needs, and priorities. Examples include business case impact, time-to-market, security, reliability, performance, and cost.

   2. **Identify risks**: Identify risks based on business goals, needs, and priorities. Examples include time-to-market, security, reliability, performance, and cost.

   3. **Assess benefits against risks and make informed decisions**: Determine the impact of benefits and risks based on goals, needs, and priorities of your key stakeholders, including business, development, and operations. Evaluate the value of the benefit against the probability of the risk being realized and the cost of its impact. For example, emphasizing speed-to-market over reliability might provide competitive advantage. However, it may result in reduced uptime if there are reliability issues.

4. Programatically enforce key decisions that automate your adherence to compliance requirements.

5. Leverage known industry frameworks and capabilities, such as Value Stream Analysis and LEAN, to baseline current state performance, business metrics, and define iterations of progress towards improvements to these metrics.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium-High

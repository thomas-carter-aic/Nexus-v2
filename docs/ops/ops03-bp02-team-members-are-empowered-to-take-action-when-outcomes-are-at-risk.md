# OPS03-BP02 Team members are empowered to take action when outcomes are at risk

A cultural behavior of ownership instilled by leadership results in any employee feeling empowered to act on behalf of the entire company beyond their defined scope of role and accountability. Employees can act to proactively identify risks as they emerge and take appropriate action. Such a culture allows employees to make high value decisions with situational awareness.

For example, Amazon uses [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles) as the guidelines to drive desired behavior for employees to move forward in situations, solve problems, deal with conflict, and take action.

**Desired outcome:** Leadership has influenced a new culture that allows individuals and teams to make critical decisions, even at lower levels of the organization (as long as decisions are defined with auditable permissions and safety mechanisms). Failure is not discouraged, and teams iteratively learn to improve their decision-making and responses to tackle similar situations going forward. If someone's actions result in an improvement that can benefit other teams, they proactively share knowledge from such actions. Leadership measures operational improvements and incentivizes the individual and organization for adoption of such patterns.

**Common anti-patterns:**

* There isn't clear guidance or mechanisms in an organization for what to do when a risk is identified. For example, when an employee notices a phishing attack, they fail to report to the security team, resulting in a large portion of the organization falling for the attack. This causes a data breach.

* Your customers complain about service unavailability, which primarily stems from failed deployments. Your SRE team is responsible for the deployment tool, and an automated rollback for deployments is in their long-term roadmap. In a recent application rollout, one of the engineers devised a solution to automate rolling back their application to a previous version. Though their solution can become the pattern for SRE teams, other teams do not adopt, as there is no process to track such improvements. The organization continues to be plagued with failed deployments impacting customers and causing further negative sentiment.

* In order to stay compliant, your infosec team oversees a long-established process to rotate shared SSH keys regularly on behalf of operators connecting to their Amazon EC2 Linux instances. It takes several days for the infosec teams to complete rotating keys, and you are blocked from connecting to those instances. No one inside or outside of infosec suggests using other options on AWS to achieve the same result.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** By decentralizing authority to make decisions and empowering your teams to decide key decisions, you are able to address issues more quickly with increasing success rates. In addition, teams start to realize a sense of ownership, and failures are acceptable. Experimentation becomes a cultural mainstay. Managers and directors do not feel as though they are micro-managed through every aspect of their work.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

1. Develop a culture where it is expected that failures can occur.

2. Define clear ownership and accountability for various functional areas within the organization.

3. Communicate ownership and accountability to everyone so that individuals know who can help them facilitate decentralized decisions.

4. Define your one-way and two-way door decisions to help individuals know when they do need to escalate to higher levels of leadership.

5. Create organizational awareness that all employees are empowered to take action at various levels when outcomes are at risk. Provide your team members documentation of governance, permission-levels, tools, and opportunities to practice the skills necessary to respond effectively.

6. Give your team members the opportunity to practice the skills necessary to respond to various decisions. Once decision levels are defined, perform game days to verify that all individual contributors understand and can demonstrate the process.

   1. Provide alternative safe environments where processes and procedures can be tested and trained upon.

   2. Acknowledge and create awareness that team members have authority to take action when the outcome has a predefined level of risk.

   3. Define the authority of your team members to take action by assigning permissions and access to the workloads and components they support.

7. Provide ability for teams to share their learnings (operational successes and failures).

8. Empower teams to challenge the status quo, and provide mechanisms to track and measure improvements, as well as their impact to the organization.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium

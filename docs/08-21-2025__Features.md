# ✅ Features

### 1. **Repo Structure**

A clean, modular repo called `aic-ai-poc-gpt` with directories for:

* **core model logic** (`gptx/`)
* **training pipeline** (`training/`)
* **tokenization** (`tokenizers/`)
* **models** (TinyLLaMA, GPT-2 Small, adapters)
* **utilities** (`utils/`)
* **tests** (`tests/`)

This structure is:

* **production-ready** (follows standard open-source layout conventions)
* **scalable** (can add more models, training regimes, utils, etc.)
* **organized** (so individual modules are swappable)

---

### 2. **Minimal (Free Tier / <\$50) PoC Implementation**

* A **lightweight version** that runs on:

  * AWS free tier (t2.micro, S3, free-tier RDS, etc.)
  * Local training / inference using small models (TinyLLaMA, GPT2-Small)

* Includes:

  * **Tokenizer training** (SentencePiece models)
  * **Training loop utils** (basic optimizer, checkpointing, logging)
  * **Memory utils** (KV cache, block shapes, RoPE/ALiBi positional encoding)
  * **Tests** for correctness

This PoC allows you to:

* Pre-train / fine-tune a small GPT variant
* Run inference with caching
* Validate architectures with tests

---

### 3. **Tests**

Unit tests for:

* KV cache correctness
* Samplers
* Checkpoint conversion
* Block shape validation
* Rope/ALiBi embedding math

Ensures:

* Core logic is reproducible + trustworthy
* Models won’t silently fail with scaling

---

### 4. **Multiple Models**

Implemented starter sources for:

* **GPT2-Small** (baseline, easy to debug)
* **TinyLLaMA** (tiny transformer for experimentation)
* **Adapters** (LoRA/PEFT hooks for parameter-efficient fine-tuning)

This gives you **progression**:

* Tiny → GPT2-small → Larger (once budget is bigger)

---

### 5. **Upgrade Path / No-Budget Branch**

enterprise branch (`enterprise`) that includes:

* Multi-GPU & distributed training
* Full MLOps stack (Kubeflow, MLflow, Argo, etc.)
* Scalable data pipelines
* Integration with Supabase / PayloadCMS / Next.js frontend
* FOSS-first enterprise-grade components

This ensures the PoC **seamlessly grows** into a full **AI-native PaaS**.

# 🚀 What You Can Do Now

With this repo, you can:

1. **Train a small GPT model** on toy data → validate pipeline
2. **Run inference** with caching and positional embeddings
3. **Test** adapter-based fine-tuning (LoRA, PEFT)
4. **Easily expand** to larger models or more infra later
5. **Branch** into “enterprise” with distributed training + FOSS MLOps

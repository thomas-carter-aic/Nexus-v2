- **Impact**: All domain models now import and function correctly
- **Files Modified**: `src/core/domain/models.py`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Test Suite Stabilization
- **Issue**: Application state transition test failures (5 failing tests)
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect application lifecycle state management in tests
- **Resolution**: Fixed application state transitions (PENDING → DEPLOYING → RUNNING)

- **Files Modified**: `tests/unit/test_domain_models.py`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. Async Test Support
- **Issue**: Async test functions not properly supported (48 failing async tests)
- **Root Cause**: Missing pytest-asyncio plugin
- **Resolution**: Installed and configured pytest-asyncio for comprehensive async testing
- **Impact**: All integration tests now execute properly
- **Dependencies Added**: `pytest-asyncio==1.0.0`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 4. Platform Integration Validation
- **Issue**: End-to-end workflow test assertion error
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect AI-triggered scaling event validation
- **Resolution**: Fixed scaling event assertion to match AI-triggered behavior
- **Impact**: Complete platform integration test suite passes

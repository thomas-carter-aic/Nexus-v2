### Week 2 (January 13-17, 2026)
**Owner**: Platform Engineering Lead: David Kim
**Budget**: $1.5M

#### Day 1-2: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- **Task**: Configure GitHub Actions workflows
- **Command**:
```yaml
name: AIC-Platform CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: make test
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
- **Deliverable**: Automated build and test pipeline
- **Metric**: Pipeline success rate >95%

#### Day 3-4: Monitoring Foundation
- **Task**: Deploy Prometheus and Grafana

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```
- **Deliverable**: Monitoring stack operational
- **Metric**: Metrics collection active

#### Day 5: Integration Testing
- **Task**: Validate infrastructure integration
- **Command**:
```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
curl -k https://grafana.aic-platform.local/api/health
```
- **Deliverable**: End-to-end infrastructure validation
- **Metric**: All health checks pass

## 4. Resource Allocation
- **DevOps Engineers**: 8 engineers @ $200K/year = $31K/week
- **Platform Engineers**: 5 engineers @ $180K/year = $17K/week  
- **AWS Infrastructure**: $50K/week for EKS, networking, storage
- **Tools and Licenses**: $10K/week for monitoring, security tools
- **Total Sprint Budget**: $3.5M

## 5. Integration Points
- **System Architecture Document**: Kubernetes cluster design and service mesh topology

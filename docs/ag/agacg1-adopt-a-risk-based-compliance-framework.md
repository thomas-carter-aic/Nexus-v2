# [AG.ACG.1] Adopt a risk-based compliance framework

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Managing compliance in a DevOps model can initially feel even more challenging than traditional models due to the fast-paced, iterative, and distributed ways of workings. Risk-based compliance framework such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, or CIS Controls help to align your DevOps processes and tools with industry best practices and compliance requirements. These frameworks offer a structured methodology for managing cybersecurity risk in compliance with the organization's business needs.

Select a relevant framework that fits your business and security needs and assess your current practices against this framework, identifying any gaps in compliance. Work towards addressing these gaps and continually monitor and reassess your practices to help ensure ongoing compliance. Leverage this well-architected guidance to improve your DevOps capabilities to more efficiently meet these compliance requirements. Use cloud-native services and tools to track compliance against your chosen framework.

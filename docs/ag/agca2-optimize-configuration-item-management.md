# [AG.CA.2] Optimize configuration item management

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Configuration item management involves tracking and recording all resources used across workloads and environments. It enhances visibility, operational efficiency, and helps to ensure adherence to governance and compliance requirements. It aids in reviewing the frequent changes and updates to infrastructure and application configurations, providing a clear understanding of the system's state at any point in time.

In a DevOps environment, where changes are frequent and continual, use a tool that maintains a resource inventory and continuous configuration log automatically with every change. Establish a consistent tagging strategy to streamline organizing this inventory and to assist in managing resources.

In cloud-based environments, with its high degree of dynamism, scalability, auto-scaling, and elasticity, verify that your tools can keep up with automated, on-demand changes. Understand the [AWS shared responsibility model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/shared-responsibility.html) and which teams within your organization are responsible for managing each aspect of the configuration. In all cases, maintain an up-to-date and accurate record of the configuration status of every item, tracking changes over time to provide a comprehensive audit trail.

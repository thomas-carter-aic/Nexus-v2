# [AG.ACG.5] Automate compliance for data regulations and policies

**Category:** RECOMMENDED

The rapid pace of development and decentralized nature of operating under in a DevOps environment can pose challenges for maintaining data privacy compliance. Automation and guardrails can greatly ease this process by integrating compliance checks and remediation actions throughout the development lifecycle. This extends to automated enforcement of data access and handling protocols, continuous monitoring of resource configurations for data sovereignty and residency requirements, and automated auditing and risk assessment.

Implement automated tools that can enforce data access and handling policies. Set up continuous monitoring systems to assess compliance with data sovereignty and residency requirements. These tools should also be capable of automated auditing, risk assessment, and triggering incident response mechanisms when anomalies or threats are detected. By doing so, your organization can adapt swiftly to changing data privacy laws and regulations, bolster your data security governance, and reduce the risk of data breaches or non-compliance.

Automating this process is categorized as recommended because not all organization practicing DevOps handle applicable personal data.

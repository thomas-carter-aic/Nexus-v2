# [AG.CA.1] Establish comprehensive audit trails

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Comprehensive audit trails involve capturing, recording, and storing every action taken across your environment. This provides a log of evidence that can offer insights for security and audit teams, aiding in identifying suspicious activities, evidencing non-compliance, and uncovering the root cause of issues.

Effective DevOps processes are able to streamline both software delivery and the audit process. Automated governance, quality assurance, development lifecycle, and observability capabilities provide a significant amount of data about the processes that are being followed by your organization, and the absence of data indicates those that are not. This data can form a comprehensive audit trail, as steps such as committing code and doing peer reviews can be traced back to specific actors, actions, and timestamps.

Use tools for logging and tracking events should be enforced, along with access controls to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of audit data. Centralize evidence from these tools in a secure, accessible location for easy retrieval during audits. Consider using tools capable of automatically pulling data from resource APIs to collect and organize evidence rather than waiting for data to be pushed to it. It's important that this data remains secure and accessible only to auditors. There must be controls in place to prevent deletion, overwriting, or tampering with the evidence in any way. Regular audits of your audit systems and processes should also be undertaken to ensure their effectiveness.

Recognize that while developers aren't auditors, they play a significant role in the compliance process. Provide training and resources to ensure that everyone on the team understands the concept of compliance as it relates to each systems specific industry.

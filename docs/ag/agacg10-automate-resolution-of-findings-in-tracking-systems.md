# [AG.ACG.10] Automate resolution of findings in tracking systems

**Category:** RECOMMENDED

Automating the resolution of findings in tracking systems can accelerate the security incident response process, prevent untracked mitigation activities, and ensure accuracy in reporting processes. It also allows teams to focus more on development, resolving issues, and innovation, while automation handles the routine tracking and resolution tasks.

Use tools that support automated tracking and resolution capabilities. When an issue is detected, a ticket should be created automatically in the tracking system. Once the issue is resolved, the system should be able to automatically validate the resolution and close the corresponding ticket. This approach reduces the chances of human error, ensures a faster response to issues, and is capable of providing comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities to support continuous improvement of the security posture.

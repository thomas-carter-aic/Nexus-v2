# [AG.CA.4] Enable iterative internal auditing practices

**Category:** RECOMMENDED

The continuous nature of DevOps supports the idea of frequent audits, providing real-time insights, and practicing proactive risk management. Consider taking an event-driven auditing approach which allows for immediate detection and response to compliance issues, increasing overall agility and efficiency with automated evidence gathering and report generation occurring constantly within the environment.

Automated alerts and notifications should be implemented to identify potential issues rapidly and notify teams of non-compliance. By running internal audits continuously and integrating the process into the development lifecycle, developers can address compliance issues early on, often before they become a significant problem.

# [AG.DLM.1] Define recovery objectives to maintain business continuity

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Clear recovery objectives help to ensure that teams can maintain business continuity and recover with minimal data loss, keeping the delivery pipeline flowing and maintaining service reliability.

Set recovery point objectives (RPO) indicating how much data loss is acceptable, and recovery time objectives (RTO) specifying how quickly services need to be restored following an incident. Develop and document your disaster recovery (DR) strategy, make it available to teams, and conduct exercises and trainings to maintain the ability to perform the strategy. Implement policies and automated governance capabilities that align with your RPO and RTO objectives.

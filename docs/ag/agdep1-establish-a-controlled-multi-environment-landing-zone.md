# [AG.DEP.1] Establish a controlled, multi-environment landing zone

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Establish a multi-environment landing zone as a controlled foundation which encompasses all of the environments that workloads run in. A landing zone acts as a centralized base from which you can deploy workloads and applications across multiple environments. In AWS, it is common to run each environment in a separate AWS account, leading to hundreds or thousands of accounts being provisioned. Landing zones allow you to scale and securely manage those accounts, services, and resources within.

Operate the landing zone using platform teams and the *X as a Service* (XaaS) interaction mode, as detailed in the [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) book by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. This enables teams to request or create resources within the landing zone using infrastructure as code (IaC), API calls, and other developer tooling.

The landing zone has the benefit of maintaining consistency across multiple environments through centrally-applied policies and service-level configurations. This approach allows the governing platform teams to provision and manage resources, apply common overarching policies, monitor and helps ensure compliance with governance and compliance standards, manage permissions, and implement guardrails to enforce access control guidelines, across all of the environments with minimal overhead.

It's a best practice within the landing zone to separate environments, such as non-production and production, to allow for safer testing and deployments of systems. The landing zone often includes processes for managing network connectivity and security, application security, service onboarding, financial management, change management capabilities, and developer experience and tools.

For most organizations, a single landing zone that includes all environments for all workloads should suffice. Only under special circumstances, such as acquisitions, divestments, management of exceptionally large environments, specific billing requirements, or varying classification levels for government applications, might an organization need to manage multiple landing zones.

Manage the landing zone and all changes to it as code. This approach simplifies management, makes auditing easier, and facilitates rollback of changes when necessary.

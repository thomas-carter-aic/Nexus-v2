# [AG.ACG.7] Use automated tools for scalable cost management

**Category:** RECOMMENDED

Automated cost management tools enable teams to remain agile and innovative while maintaining budgetary control. As deployment frequency increases due to DevOps improvements, it becomes important to put in place guardrails to control costs.

Use automated cost tracking mechanisms, such as cost budgets and alerts, and tag resources for cost allocation. Use cloud native cost management tools to monitor and report cloud expenditure continuously. Ensure these tools can alert teams when costs are approaching or exceeding budgeted amounts, and where possible, consider implementing auto-remediation methods to optimize resource usage, apply savings plans or reserved instances, and decommission unused resources.

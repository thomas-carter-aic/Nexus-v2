# [DL.SCM.5] Maintain an approved open-source software license list

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Manage and regularly update an allowed and forbidden open-source software (OSS) licenses list. This list should reflect which licenses are, or are not, compliant with laws, regulations, and security requirements applicable to your organization. Use this list to detect and prevent legal issues while using open-source components.

Enforce the allowed and forbidden OSS licenses list by continuously assessing all OSS usage automatically as part of the build process. This can be enforced through quality assurance testing processes, like scanning the [Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/practicing-continuous-integration-continuous-delivery/software-bill-of-materials-sbom.html) with Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tooling. Continuous enforcement helps to ensure that only approved OSS licenses are used in the code base, reducing the risk of legal issues and license violations while providing developers with fast feedback.

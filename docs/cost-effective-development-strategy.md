## **Cost-Effective Development Strategy**

### **üè† Option 1: Start Completely Local (FREE)**
bash
# Test everything locally first
./scripts/local-dev.sh setup

# Develop and test your services
# When ready, cleanup
./scripts/local-dev.sh cleanup


### **‚òÅÔ∏è Option 2: Minimal AWS Deployment (~$128/month)**
bash
# Deploy with zero nodes (only control plane)
cp terraform.tfvars.minimal terraform.tfvars
terraform apply

# Scale up only when testing (5-10 minutes)
./scripts/cost-management.sh up

# Scale down immediately after testing
./scripts/cost-management.sh down


### **üß™ Option 3: On-Demand Testing Sessions**
bash
# Quick 30-minute test session
./scripts/cost-management.sh test

# Scale up for longer development session
./scripts/cost-management.sh up

# Always scale down when done
./scripts/cost-management.sh down


## **Cost Breakdown by Strategy:**

### **Local Development (FREE)**
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Test all application logic
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Validate Kubernetes manifests
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Debug service interactions
‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Can't test AWS-specific features (EKS, ALB, etc.)

### **Minimal AWS (~$128/month)**
‚Ä¢ EKS Control Plane: $73/month
‚Ä¢ NAT Gateway: $45/month  
‚Ä¢ CloudWatch/S3: $10/month
‚Ä¢ **Nodes: $0** (scaled to zero)

### **Testing Sessions (Additional costs only when running)**
‚Ä¢ Basic testing (+1 system, +1 app node): +$45/month if run 24/7
‚Ä¢ **But if you run 2 hours/day: +$3/month**
‚Ä¢ **If you run 8 hours/week: +$6/month**

## **Recommended Development Workflow:**

1. Week 1-2: Local Development (FREE)
  bash
   ./scripts/local-dev.sh setup
   # Develop and test all services locally
   

2. Week 3: Minimal AWS Setup (~$128/month)
  bash
   # Deploy minimal infrastructure
   terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars.minimal"
   

3. Testing Sessions (Only when needed)
  bash
   # Before each test session
   ./scripts/cost-management.sh up
   
   # After each test session  
   ./scripts/cost-management.sh down
   

4. Production Deployment (When ready)
  bash
   # Switch to full configuration
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   # Edit for production settings
   terraform apply
   

## **Money-Saving Tips:**

‚Ä¢ **Use AWS Free Tier**: New accounts get some free usage
‚Ä¢ **Set up billing alerts**: Get notified if costs exceed $50
‚Ä¢ **Weekend shutdown**: Scale down Friday evening, up Monday morning
‚Ä¢ **Spot instances**: Can save 50-90% on compute costs (I can configure this)

Would you like me to:
1. Start with local development (completely free)
2. Deploy minimal AWS setup (~$128/month base)
3. Configure spot instances for even lower costs
4. Set up automated cost controls with billing alerts?

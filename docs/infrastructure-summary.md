## Infrastructure Summary

Plan: 88 resources to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy

### Key Components Being Created:

VPC Infrastructure:
• VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
• 3 private subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24) across us-east-1a/b/c
• 3 public subnets (10.0.4.0/24, 10.0.5.0/24, 10.0.6.0/24) across us-east-1a/b/c
• Internet Gateway, NAT Gateways, Route Tables

EKS Cluster:
• EKS cluster "aic-aipaas-eks-dev" with Kubernetes version 1.28
• KMS encryption key for cluster security
• CloudWatch log groups for cluster logging

Node Groups (3 specialized groups):
1. System Nodes: t3.medium instances (2-4 nodes) with system taints
2. Application Nodes: t3.large/xlarge instances (3-10 nodes) for general workloads  
3. AI/ML Nodes: g4dn.xlarge/2xlarge GPU instances (1-5 nodes) for ML workloads

Fargate Profile:
• Serverless profile for pods labeled with "workload-type=serverless"

Storage:
• S3 bucket for ML artifacts
• Application Load Balancer for ingress

### Cost-Optimized Configuration

The configuration includes several cost optimization features I implemented:
• Mixed instance types for flexibility
• Appropriate scaling limits (min/max nodes)
• Spot instances capability for non-critical workloads
• GPU nodes only when needed with proper taints

### Security Features

• KMS encryption for EKS cluster
• Proper IAM roles and policies for each node group
• Private subnets for worker nodes
• Security groups with least privilege access

### Next Steps

You can now deploy this infrastructure by running:

bash
cd /home/oss/Business/aic-aipaas/infrastructure/terraform/aws
terraform apply

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome of Work So Far
### Date: 08-21-2025

### 1. **Repository Structure**

You now have a fully scaffolded repository (`aic-ai-poc-gpt`) with clear submodules:

* **`notebooks/`** â€“ Jupyter research notebooks for experiments:

  * `03_long_context_pi_ntk.ipynb` â†’ scaling/positional encoding experiments
  * `04_serving_latency_tradeoffs.ipynb` â†’ benchmarking inference throughput vs. latency
  * `finetune_demo.ipynb` â†’ hands-on finetuning demo (toy dataset â†’ real pipeline ready)
  * `inference_demo.ipynb` â†’ load trained models + run inference

* **`training/`** â€“ Training framework utilities:

  * `utils.py` â†’ helpers for dataset prep, logging, distributed setup
  * `train.py` â†’ minimal but extendable training loop (supports checkpointing, optimizer, scheduler, mixed precision)

* **`tokenizers/`** â€“ Full tokenizer pipeline:

  * `utils.py` â†’ normalization/cleaning helpers
  * `train_spm.py` â†’ SentencePiece training script
  * `spm_model.py` â†’ wrapper for loading + using trained tokenizer models

* **`tests/`** â€“ Unit tests for correctness:

  * `test_sampler.py` â†’ dataset sampling correctness
  * `test_rope_alibi.py` â†’ validates RoPE/ALiBi attention mechanisms
  * `test_kv_cache.py` â†’ correctness/performance of KV caching
  * `test_checkpoint_convert.py` â†’ checkpoint compatibility across formats
  * `test_block_shapes.py` â†’ tensor shape + memory validation

* **`models/`** â€“ Multiple reference model families:

  * `adapters/` â†’ lightweight fine-tuning via LoRA/adapters
  * `gpt2_small/` â†’ small baseline GPT-2 style implementation
  * `tinyllama/` â†’ compact LLaMA-like model for experimentation

### 2. **Functionality Covered**

âœ… **Training** â€“ End-to-end training loop + utilities
âœ… **Tokenizer** â€“ Train + load SentencePiece tokenizers
âœ… **Model Architectures** â€“ GPT2-small, TinyLLaMA, adapters (LoRA)
âœ… **Inference** â€“ Demo inference pipeline with caching + batching
âœ… **Research Experiments** â€“ Long context scaling + serving latency trade-offs
âœ… **Testing** â€“ Core correctness tests for critical components
âœ… **Baseline PoC Deployment** â€“ Designed for AWS free tier (<\$50/month) with minimal compute/storage assumptions

---

### 3. **Branching Strategy**

* **`main` branch** â†’ PoC, minimal, AWS free-tier friendly (everything small/cheap, proof-of-concept)
* **`pro` branch** â†’ enterprise-ready, no budget constraint (larger models, distributed training, full observability, more infra, advanced serving stack)

As of now everything for the **PoC / free-tier budget version** in place.

## ðŸš€ What This Gives Us

We effectively now have:

1. **A working AI research & prototyping repo** â€“ train toy-scale models, fine-tune, run inference, evaluate context scaling, test serving strategies.
2. **A foundation to extend into full production** â€“ with branching (`pro` branch) we can scale into distributed training, bigger models, GPUs, orchestration, monitoring.
3. **A teaching + validation tool** â€“ the notebooks demonstrate concepts like tokenizer training, positional encodings, fine-tuning, and inference optimizations.
4. **Confidence in correctness** â€“ via unit tests on the hardest-to-get-right pieces (samplers, KV cache, checkpoint conversions).

---

ðŸ“Œ In short:
We now have a **mini-LLM R\&D lab in repo form**, with training, inference, tokenizer, baseline models, and tests â€” designed first for budget-constrained PoC, but structured to branch into a full, unconstrained enterprise-grade platform.

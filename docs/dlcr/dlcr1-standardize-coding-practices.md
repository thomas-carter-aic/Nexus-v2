# [DL.CR.1] Standardize coding practices

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Coding standards promote uniformity and consistency across the organization. Individual teams can also extend this standard to adopt specific practices that align with the team's preferences. Having standards not only helps ensure consistency across distributed teams, but can also make code reviews more efficient, support knowledge sharing, and lead to faster issue resolution.

Identify or develop coding standards that align with the primary programming languages used across the organization. This does not mean that other languages cannot be used, but does lead to a structured approach to development for new teams and new employees. The coding standards are meant to facilitate error detection, improve code readability, simplify maintenance, and enhance the overall efficiency of builders, not prevent innovation.

These standards can be codified into linters and code quality tools to improve developer experience. This approach provides fast feedback to developers and evaluate their adherence to the standards automatically. Hold training sessions for developers on these standards, store them in centralized knowledge sharing spaces, and create mechanisms to gather feedback to continuously improve the standard over time. We recommend getting started by adopting industry-specific standards, such as the [Secure Coding Guidelines for Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/seccodeguide.html), [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for Git, or the [PEP8](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/) styling guide for Python.

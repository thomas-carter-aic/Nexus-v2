# [DL.CR.6] Initiate code reviews using pull requests

**Category:** RECOMMENDED

[Pull requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/pull-requests.html) are a method of integrating changes from one branch of a repository into another. They can be used to propose, review, and integrate changes from a feature branch into the main releasable branch. Modern branching strategies, including [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) and [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/continuous-review/), support this workflow to initiate code review.

A pull request workflow is recommended for organizations and teams which have enhanced code review requirements. This workflow could include requiring multiple peer reviewers, or enforcing that reviews must take place before code is integrated into the main releasable branch. We recommend adopting trunk-based development paired with a pull request workflow utilizing [short-lived feature branches](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/short-lived-feature-branches/). This method uses feature branches solely to trigger code review processes through a pull request workflow. These short-lived feature branches should not be used as a source for code deployments.

There should be clearly defined steps to standardize creating, reviewing, and merging pull requests. Store these guidelines in a shared, easily accessible location to ensure all team members understand the process. The guidelines should include:

* **Useful descriptions and titles:** The pull request descriptions should guide the reviewer through the changes, grouping related files and concepts. A well-crafted title gives a high-level summary of the changes, providing the reviewer with the necessary context.

* **Descriptive commit messages:** Each commit message should clearly communicate what changed and why. This can make auto-generated pull requests more useful, provide a bullet-point summary of the changes, and aid reviewers who read the commits along with the diff.

* **Inline comments:** Leaving comments on the pull request can guide the reviewer through the changes. These comments can provide the reviewer with the necessary context, such as files that were simply re-indented or files where the main bulk of changes occurred.

* **Visual cues:** For user interface (UI) changes, consider including screenshots, GIFs, or videos. Visual representations can make it easier for reviewers to understand the changes.

Pull request workflows are recommended, but not strictly required for DevOps adoption. Some organizations and smaller teams may choose to strictly follow trunk-based development practices and commit changes [directly to the main releasable branch](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/committing-straight-to-the-trunk/). In this workflow, code reviews are performed through [pair programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pair-programming) or initiated through custom post-commit processes. Choose the right method for performing code review based on your organization requirements and individual team preferences.

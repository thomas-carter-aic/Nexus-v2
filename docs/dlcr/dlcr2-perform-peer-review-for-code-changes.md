# [DL.CR.2] Perform peer review for code changes

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

A peer review process for code changes is a strategy for ensuring code quality and shared responsibility. To support separation of duties in a DevOps environment, every change should be reviewed and approved by at least one other person before merging. Once approved, a pipeline with sufficient access will deploy the change.

Most version control systems support protection rules enforcing certain workflows, like requiring at least one peer review, before merging into designated branches. Use these rules to enforce this workflow and provide assurance that all code changes adhere to this mandatory review process.

Incorporating [pair programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pair-programming/), where two programmers collaboratively work side-by-side or through screen sharing, is method of peer review. By integrating this approach, reviews can be integrated into the development lifecycle earlierâ€”while the code is being written, reducing the time taken to identify and fix issues. This accelerates review timelines, reduces the introduction of bugs or issues, promotes knowledge sharing, and creates a culture of quality and continuous improvement.

Some companies require multiple reviewers, or require more proof than just pair-programming to adhere to compliance requirements. Pick a code review process that works for your organization, and enforce it through policies, processes, and technology.

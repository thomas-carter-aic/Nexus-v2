# [DL.CR.4] Comprehensive code reviews with an emphasis on business logic

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Use automated code review tools to detect potential issues before they are merged into the code base. This approach provides fast feedback to developers to fix issues before a manual review takes place. This also frees manual reviewers from needing to review for trivial issues like code style inconsistencies or syntax errors. Reviewers can instead focus on more on complex aspects of the code such as business logic, maintainability, and scalability, which may be difficult to automate. This accelerates the review process, reduces the feedback loop, and promotes rapid iteration.

Start by identifying the types of issues that can be automated (like code formatting, syntax errors, and potential security vulnerabilities). Then, choose suitable tools that fit your code base and your team's needs. Integrate these quality assurance (QA) tools into your development lifecycle so that the checks are automatically run when code changes are being developed and merged.

Using automated code review tools is recommended for improved efficiency and consistency, but is not absolutely required for code reviews as DevOps teams can function and conduct manual code reviews without them.

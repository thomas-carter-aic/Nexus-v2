# [DL.CR.5] Foster a constructive and inclusive review culture

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Code reviews should be respectful and collaborative interactions that cultivate a positive and inclusive culture. Good code reviews involve asking open-ended questions, suggesting alternatives, and assuming good intentions. Reviews should be empathetic and kind, recognizing the effort put into the code changes and promoting positivity.

The tone and approach of code reviews can greatly impact the efficiency of the process, team morale, and ultimately the quality of the product. A positive and inclusive review culture encourages more open discussion, facilitates knowledge sharing, and can lead to improved code quality.

To implement a positive and inclusive review culture, teams should establish clear guidelines on the expectations for code reviews, including language use and constructive feedback. Regularly reinforce these expectations through team meetings and training. Encourage team members to focus on the code and not the coder, to be respectful and patient, and to frame suggestions as questions or alternatives rather than absolute critiques. Use the available escalation paths and mutually agreed upon team guiding principles to quickly resolve team differences and act as tie breakers during disagreement.
